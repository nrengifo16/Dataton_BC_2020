# Dataton_BC_2020

I developed an algorithm to clean the given data set. Since many registers and variables were considered it was needed to use specific libraries in order to reduce the
 computational run time. Along with my team work, we developed a multi variate regression model that allows to predict how much money will a person spend in month.
 It was trained based on a data set that contains demographic and socioeconomic variables for each person.
